## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ **What are we building?**  
We are developing an intelligent application that brings **personal AI into project management and chat**, helping individuals and teams manage everything they want to handle in one unified workspace.

Our platform combines **AI-powered project management with conversational interaction**, allowing users to plan, organize, and execute tasks simply by talking to their AI. No more switching between tools—your projects, conversations, and decisions live together.

A key feature of our system is **agent modularity**. Users can import, create, or connect any AI agent they want—such as planners, researchers, mentors, financial assistants, health trackers, or fully custom agents—and use them seamlessly across their personal and professional life.

🌈 **How can you contribute?**  
We welcome contributors from all backgrounds—developers, designers, AI researchers, and product thinkers.
- Improve core features and integrations  
- Build or share custom agents  
- Help with documentation, testing, and UX  
- Share ideas and feedback through issues and discussions  

👩‍💻 **Useful resources**  
- Documentation and setup guides (coming soon)  
- API & agent integration references  
- Architecture and roadmap updates  
- Community discussions and examples  

🍿 **Fun facts**  
Our team believes great ideas start with good coffee ☕, clear thinking, and a strong belief that AI should work *for* people, not the other way around.

🧙 **Our mission**  
To simplify complexity by turning AI into a **personal, practical, and extensible manager**—one that understands your goals, adapts to your context, and helps you manage work, projects, and life seamlessly.
